### User Stories

* As a user, when I visit the website I see a link to another page that allows me to navigate to it. 

* As a user, inspirational quotes are retrieved from an API so that I can see a random quote of the day and an option to choose from the quotes in teh API.

* As a user, I can type in an input box and search for inspirational quotes based on the input, (e.g. love) so that the quote appears.

* As a user, if I try to submit with no entry in the input box, I see a message on the screen telling me to enter a value to search so that I cannot submit without entering a value.

* As a user, I can click on a quote so that I can view a single photo with the quote and the author.
